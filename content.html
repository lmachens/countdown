You're probably wondering what I've been working on
for the past few weeks.<br />This is
it! A way for me to leave you lovey-dovey messages. That's really it, for now.
Once you read a message, it gets archived in an advent-calendar-looking list at the
bottom (numbered 1, 2, and so on). Once you open a message, you'll have to wait 24 hours for the next message to arrive.<br />So in 24 hours, you'll have a new message!

Messages won't open themselves, though, so if you don't visit the app for 10 days,
you'll still only have one message to open (and not ten).<br />I have a few more
features planned down the road, maybe adding a two-way feature so you can leave
me 24 hour messages as well. Adding formatting like italics and bold, images,
coupons (like "free hug" or "snap a selfie and send it to me") are also in the
works.<br />I hope you enjoy some of the upcoming messages!
