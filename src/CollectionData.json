Once you read a message, it gets archived in an advent-calendar-looking list at the bottom (numbered 1, 2, and so on). Once you open a message, you'll have to wait 24 hours for the next message to arrive.<br />So in 24 hours, you'll have a new message!<br />Edit: As of today (11/2/2022) you can star your favorite messages with the star button below!"

      "description": "Prompt: Write a short story about Miffy the bunny and Henry the bear having an adventure in the Mysterious Forest. At the end of their adventure, they realize there was nothing to be afraid of because they had each other.\n<br />\nMiffy the bunny and Henry the bear were the best of friends. They were always coming up with new adventures and looking for new places to explore.\n<br />\nOne day, Miffy and Henry decided to go on a grand adventure to the Mysterious Forest. Neither of them had ever been there before and they were both a bit scared, but they were determined to brave their fears together.\n<br />\nThey set off early in the morning, walking through the trees and feeling the cool breeze on their fur. As they ventured further and further into the forest, they noticed strange things happening around them. The leaves on the trees seemed to whisper secrets to one another and the birds they saw were unlike any they had ever seen before.\n<br />\nAt first, they were a little scared, but then they heard something that sounded like laughter. Soon, they realized that it was coming from a group of friendly birds who were playing a game of tag. Miffy and Henry joined in the game and soon they were all laughing and having a grand time.\n<br />\nAfter they finished playing, Miffy and Henry continued on their way. As they ventured deeper into the forest, they began to feel less scared and more curious. They encountered all sorts of strange creatures and plants and eventually, they made it to the center of the forest.\n<br />\nWhen they arrived, they realized that there was nothing to be afraid of. All of the strange creatures and plants were harmless and they were surrounded by a feeling of peace and tranquility. They realized that the Mysterious Forest was actually home to many wonderful and beautiful things.\n<br />\nMiffy and Henry looked at each other and smiled. They had faced their fears and come out on top. Even though they were in a place full of unknowns, they knew that they had each other and that was all that mattered. \n<br />\nThey hugged and laughed, knowing that their adventure had been a success. Together, they had conquered the Mysterious Forest."
